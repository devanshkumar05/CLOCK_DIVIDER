-> What is a Clock Divider IP?
A Clock Divider IP (Intellectual Property) is a hardware module (written in Verilog, VHDL, etc.) that takes a high-frequency clock (like 100 MHz) as input and produces a lower-frequency clock (like 25 MHz, 10 MHz, etc.) as output.

-> Why is Clock Division Needed?
In RISC-V or any SoC design:

Some peripherals (UART, I2C, SPI, timers) require slower clocks than the main CPU clock.

You may want to reduce power consumption for certain blocks.

You might want to synchronize signals across clock domains (though that requires more than just a divider).

-> How Clock Divider Works
It works by counting input clock cycles and toggling the output clock after a certain count.

Example (DIVISOR = 4):
clk_in	↑ ↑ ↑ ↑ ↑ ↑ ↑ ↑ ↑ ↑ ↑ ↑ ↑ ↑
count	0 1 2 3 0 1 2 3 0 1 2 3
clk_out	0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1

So:

Every 2 clock edges (DIVISOR / 2), the clk_out toggles.
So total period = 4 clk_in cycles → frequency is divided by 4.

Key Components of the IP
Component	        Role
-> clk_in	        Input clock, usually system clock
-> rst_n	        Active-low reset, used to initialize counter and output
-> counter	        Counts clock cycles to control toggling
-> clk_out	        Output clock at lower frequency
-> DIVISOR	        Parameter to decide how much to divide the input clock

-> Integration in RISC-V SoC
As a Peripheral:
can connect the clk_out to:

UART module (needs specific baud rates)
PWM/timer blocks
Slow memory interface
Debug or watchdog timers

As a Shared Clock Source:

Provide multiple divided clocks to different components.
If using dynamic divisors, connect the module to a bus (like AXI/APB) to update DIVISOR from software.

-> Benefits
Simple, compact hardware.
Saves power by slowing peripherals.
Reduces complexity of custom clocks in synthesis and place & route.
Can be reused across designs (IP concept).
